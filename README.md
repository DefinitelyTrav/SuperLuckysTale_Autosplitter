# SuperLuckysTale_Autosplitter
A LiveSplit autosplitter and load remover for Super Lucky's Tale.

### What does it do?
As of the beta, the autosplitter currently only removes load times and splits automatically after the clover gained cutscene. It does not start the timer on New Game, reset, or end the timer on the last hit on Jinx. I might add this functionality later, but finding the memory addresses has been difficult.

### Installation
1. Download the latest release of [LiveSplit](https://github.com/LiveSplit/LiveSplit/releases)
2. Download the latest release of [Super Lucky's Tale Autosplitter](https://github.com/moosemooseOB/SuperLuckysTale_Autosplitter/releases). I recommend putting the autosplitter file in your LiveSplit folder.
3. Run LiveSplit > Right Click > Edit Layout.
4. Click the plus in the top left > Control > Scriptable Autosplitter
5. Browse and find SuperLucky'sTale.asl and open it.

**NOTE:** The load remover is only reflected in the timer if it has Game Time selected in its timing method. It would also be a good idea to have your splits compare against game time.

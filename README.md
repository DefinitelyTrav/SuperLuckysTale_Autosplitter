# SuperLuckysTale_Autosplitter
A LiveSplit autosplitter and load remover for Super Lucky's Tale.

### What does it do?
This will automatically pause the timer during loads.

### Installation
1. Download the latest release of [LiveSplit](https://github.com/LiveSplit/LiveSplit/releases)
2. Download the latest release of [Super Lucky's Tale Autosplitter](https://github.com/DefinitelyTrav/SuperLuckysTale_LoadRemover/releases). I recommend putting the autosplitter file in your LiveSplit folder.
3. Run LiveSplit > Right Click > Edit Layout.
4. Click the plus in the top left > Control > Scriptable Autosplitter
5. Browse and find Super Lucky's Tale.asl and open it.

**NOTE:** The load remover is only reflected in the timer if it has Game Time selected in its timing method. It would also be a good idea to have your splits compare against game time.
